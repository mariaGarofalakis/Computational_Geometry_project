# Computational_Geometry_project

The purpose of this project is to implement a method that allows us to refine an area of any 3D mesh by subdividing the triangles
of the selected area as many times as required, using Laplacian Mesh Editing. The user can choose the refinement area by selecting
a center triangle and triangulate up to itâ€™s n-th order neighbour. The Laplacian Matrix system is solved in the least squares sense
by over determining the problem and the result is the refined mesh.
